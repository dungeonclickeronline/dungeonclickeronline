Welcome to the game of Dungeon Clicker!!!

The rules are simple:
1. Click the attack to wittle down the monster's health
2. Use gold to buy upgrades, potions, and spells
3. Don't die

Tips and Tricks:
1. Upgrade increase everytime you buy one
2. Stances may help keep the grind from being stale and rack up the gold quickly or save you from a pinch
3. The more monster you defeat, the harder they become
4. Health upgrade also heal you, so sometimes a better option than just a regular potion
